## 📂 Description

**📜 Summary:**\
Create a **maze generator** that takes a configuration file, generates a maze and writes it to a file using a hexadecimal wall representation. The maze will also have a visual representation either in ASCII, or by using the minilibx. The maze will be generate randomly but can be reproduce via a **seed**.

**📝 Requierements**
- Each cell of the maze has between 0 and 4 walls, at each cardinal point (North,
Est, South, West).
- The entry and exist exist, are unique, are different, need to be inside the maze bounds.
- The maze is fully connected and do not have isolated cells. Walls must be at the external borders.
- The maze can't have large open areas: corridors can't be wider than 2 cells.
- The maze must contain a visible `42` wehen represented.
- If the `PERFECT` flag is activated, the maze must contain exactly one path between the entry and the exit
- The maze must be written in the output file using one hexadecimal digit per cell, where
each digit encodes which walls are closed:
- The maze generation must be implement as a **unique class**, a standalone module that can be imported in a future project.

|Bit|Direction|
|---|---|
|0|North|
|1|East|
|2|South|
|3|West|

Closed walls = 1 | Open = 0

**✏️ Visual representation**
- Use either the **terminal ASCII** or the **MiniLibX** library.
- The visual should clearly show walls, entry, exit and the solution path.

#### **User can**:
- Re-generate a new maze and display it.
- Show/Hide a valid shortest path from the entrance to the exit.
- Change maze wall colours.
- Set specific colours to display the `42` pattern.

**📮 Makefile:**\
This project must include a Makefile with strict following rules:
- `install`: Install all project dependencies using **pip**, **uv**, **pipx**, or any other package manager.
- `run`: Execute the main script of the project.
- `debug`: Run the main script in debug mode using Python`s built-in-debugger.
- `clean`: Remove all temporary files or caches.
- `lint`: Execute **flake8** (norme checker) and **mypy** (hint checker)
- `lint-strict`: Same as above but with **--strict**.

**🐍 Challenge:**
- Avoid any crashes and give clear error message.
- Prevent any leaks.
- Include type hint *(def func (name:str) -> bool)*. Use **Mypy** to check any potential error `pip install mypy`, then `mypy script.py`
- Include docstrings following **PEP 257** for better understanding.

## 📑 Configuration file format
You can configure your maze by using those keys:

|Key|Description|Example|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|WIDTH| Maze width (number of cells)|WIDTH=20
|HEIGHT| Maze height| HEIGHT=15
|ENTRY| Entry coordinates (x,y)|ENTRY=0,0
|EXIT| Exit coordinates (x,y)|EXIT=19,14
|OUTPUT_FILE| Output filename|OUTPUT_FILE=maze.txt
|PERFECT| Is the maze perfect?|PERFECT=True
|SEED| (Optional) Seed to use|SEED=42|
|DISPLAY| (Optional) Display for rendering|DISPLAY=ascii|
|ALGORITHM| (Optional) Algorithm to use|ALGORITHM=rb|

**Display** : `emoji` *(default)* | `ascii`\
**Algorithm**: `rb` *(default)* | `huntandkill`

---

## 🖥️ Interactive terminal

When you launch the project, the maze will be draw and a menu will appear at the bottom. Use the keyboard to choose whatever option you want:

|KEY|Name|Description|
|:-:|:--:|:---------:|
|1|Re-generate a new maze|Regenerate a new maze, with a new seed|
|2|Show/Hide path from entry to exit|Show or hide the shortest path from entry to exit|
|3|Rotate maze colors|Roatate randomly the maze walls color and, if youŕe lucky, the 42 pattern|
|4|Change algorithm|Show a sub-menu in which you can choose the algorithm you want to use for the next generation|
|5|Show seed|Show the seed used|
|6|Quit|Quit the menu and the program|

## 🎮 Play mode

Using `make play` you can launch the **play mode**. It will generate a maze so that you can play on it **using the `WASD` keys, and the `E` key to quit**.

It works by using the `readchar` library the checking what key have been pressed. Then, if it can move, it change the entry/player position and print the maze.\
There is also a `count` number to try to solve the maze with the fewest possible steps.

2 modes are available:
- **Normal mode**: Starting from the entry point (magenta), find your way throught the maze and go to the exit (red).
- **Fog of war**: Starting from the entry point (magenta), find your way throught the maze that is rendered over as you go throught it.
- **Hunted**: Find the exit while a dinosaure is chasing you. If it touch you, you'll lose.

The rule `make play` will auto-install the library in the virtual environment if it not already installed.

## 📂 Architecture overview:

- **a_maze_ing.py**: The main script of the project.
- **src/utils/***: utils functions for the A_Maze_Ing project.
- **src/play/***: script to launch the maze in 'play mode'.
- **src/maze/***: The reutilisable maze generation module.

### ✍ How all of this works?

The first thing to do is to check if the maze configurations is good. So in the **src/maze/maze_config.py**, the `MazeConfig` class check, with `pydantic` if the configuration gave by the user respect the standard *(no entry or exit outside the maze, entry and exit not and the same place, etc...)*.\
If evertyhing is good, then the `MazeConfig` object can be instancied and all the configurations will be stored inside a variable.

**src/maze/maze_fortytwo_pattern.py** create the 42 pattern at the middle of the maze. The coordinates are stored in a set so it's more easy to check in the future.

The core of the module is the **src/maze/maze_generator.py**. Inside, the class `MazeGenerator` contain the maze in `self.maze`. **The main function** `maze_generator()` print the text, generate a seed if needed, the maze, print it, check if it can be solved and create the output file.\

**src/maze/maze_solver.py** contain the `MazeSolver` class used to print the shortest path (if possible), and print it.

**src/maze/errors.py** contain custom errors relative for this project.

**src/maze/customization** is a list of **Enum Class** used to customize the maze and be more efficient than a simple `self.maze_wall` (and prevent having 800 lines in the maze_generator.py).

To have the file output, to print the maze and the solution inside a file, we've created it inside the **src/maze/output/maze_ouput.py**.

Finally, all the algorithms are in **src/maze/algorithms/**.

## 🚨 MazeGenerator

- Create unique maze based on a seed (can be reproduce).
- Seed is generated automatically if user doesn't provide it.
- Render the maze based on user choice.
- Solve the maze to provide a fully functionnal maze.
- Generated **perfect** and **imperfect** mazes.
- Generated walls around the maze to keep it simple.
- Provides multiples display and algorithms.

## 🌚 Quick example

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
from maze import MazeConfig, MazeGenerator, MazeSolver, MazeConfigError, MazeGenerationError
from maze.maze_customization import MAZE, DISPLAY_MODE

# Generate the config object with custom parameters.
try:
	config = MazeConfig(width=21, height=21, entry=(0,0), exit=(18,12), output_file="maze.txt", perfect=False, display="emoji", algorithm="rb")

	# Instanciate a new maze.
	generator = MazeGenerator(config)

	# Generate a new maze and display it.
	generator.maze_generator(rendering=True)

	# Display the maze parameters.
	generator.get_maze_parameters()

	# Create new config from file.
	cool_config = MazeConfig.from_config_file("config.txt")

	# Instanciate another maze and do not render it.
	my_super_maze = MazeGenerator(cool_config)
	my_super_maze.maze_generator(rendering=False)

	# Solve a maze and print the result
	solver = MazeSolver(my_super_maze)
	solver.find_path()
	solver.print_maze_solver()

except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError, MazeConfigError, MazeGenerationError) as e:
    print(f"{type(e).__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
```

<br>

#### For maze_customization:

Our maze use Enum class type to customize the maze:
- **MAZE**: is used to check each cell. For example: `MAZE.empty` is an empty cell. So you can do something like

```python
# Check if coords are of type empty.
if generator.maze[(x, y)] == MAZE.empty:
	# do something
```

|Name|Value|
|:---:|:--:|
|EMPTY|0|
|WALL|1|
|EXIT|2|
|ENTRY|3|
|FORTYTWO|4|

- **DISPLAY_MODE**: is used to check the display mode.
```python
# Check if display is of type emoji.
if generator.display == DISPLAY_MODE.emoji:
	# do something
```

|Name|Value|
|:---:|:--:|
|ASCII|ascii|
|EMOJI|emoji|
|SIMPLE|simple|

> [!NOTE]
> "simple" is used for the debug mode, so things may not works like usual.

## 🤖 Maze generation algorithm:
1. **Explanation**:

We choose two algorithms for this project.

The first one is the **Backtracking Algorithm**.
- First, it choose a random starting point in the maze and carve a path.
- Then, it choose a random unvisited neighbor and carve a path.
- It push the current cell to the stack/history.
- If there are no unvisited neighbors (dead end), pop from the stack to return to the previous cell.
- Finally, it continue until the algorithm returns to the starting point.

The second one is the **Hunt and Kill Algorithm**.
- It choose a random starting point in the maze and carve a path.
- If it reach a dead end, then it looks for the first cell that neighbors part of the maze. It check from the left, to the right starting the first line.

2. **Why we choose this**:

We choose those algorithms for two reasons. The first one is to train on the backtracking part. The second one is just for the visual. It looks good.

3. **Part of the code reusable, and how to do it**:

All the files in the `src/maze/` folder are a part of the package.

Install the package using `pip`
```bash
pip install ~/mazegen-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Import the generator using
```python
from maze.maze_generator import MazeGenerator
```
In your code, you can use the `MazeGenerator()` function to generate a Maze and store it a variable.\
To import your configs, you can use two methods:\
- Using the `MazeConfig` import (`from maze.maze_config import MazeConfig`). Then:
```python
config = MazeConfig.from_config_file("config.txt")
```
Make sur that your config match the format above (or copy-paste the file in the repo).
- Alternatively, past your config directly in the function call:
```python
config = MazeConfig(width=50, height=50, entry=(0,0), exit=(18,12),output_file="maze.txt", perfect=False)
```
<br>

Then you can create your `MazeGenerator` object using:
```python
generator = MazeGenerator(config)
```
To generate the maze, use:
```python
generator.maze_generator(rendering=True)
```
- rendering: True to print the maze in the terminal.

<br>

Other functions:

You can print the maze parameters by using:
```python
print(generator.get_maze_parameters())
```

You can print the maze using:
```python
generator.print_maze()
```

<br>

The generator use the `MazeSolver` class itself to check if the Maze can be solved. You can import this package `from maze.maze_solver import MazeSolver` and use this function to create the `MazeSolver` object.
```python
solver = MazeSolver(generator)
```
Then, check if a path exist using:
```python
solver.find_path()
```
and print it using:
```python
solver.print_maze_solver()
```

## 🧑‍🏫 The Team:
1. Roles of each team member:

- roandrie: [norme corrector, readme writer, files organizer, writing customization and parsing]
- rruiz: [math pro, debugger, writing algorithms, docstring pro]

2. Anticipated planning, and the evolution:

There was not a planning at the start. I (roandrie) started the project before rruiz because he was still on the python modules. So I started the repo, the parsing, errors managements, creating everything we need. Then, we works and what we needed : creating the maze, filling it, creating the algorithm etc...

3. What worked well, what improvement could be done:

Our team was good. Nothing can be improved apart from our coding skill.

---

## 📂 Specific tools:

We use 3 differents libraries:
- `pydantic` to check if the config is correct.
- `colorama` to print the maze on the terminal and add colors and style in the text.
- `readchar` to allow moving the player in 'Play Mode'.
